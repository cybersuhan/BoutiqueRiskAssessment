<h1>The Boutique Hospital Risk Assessment Report</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The Boutique hospital is regularly being attacked by cybercriminals with social engineering and phishing attacks. The hospital is being targeted because of the client circle being high class personnel. This is potentially a huge problem due as the consequences of a data breach could be extremely high in terms of finance. The attacks are impacting staff randomly. The latest attacks suggest targeting 12 people at once with people on higher part of the organizational pyramid becoming primary targets.<br /><br />

In the previous year, the Chief Information Security Officer reported the social engineering attacks occurring 2 times a week on average. Moreover, the reports suggest that phishing attacks are attempted 3 times a day on average. The organization is at risk of losing its reputation and paying hefty fines due to the cyberattacks. A successful attack led to a loss of at least $2,000,000. On top of that, the organization is at risk of being listed in the HHS’ “Wall of Shame” which is a disaster for the hospital. <br /><br />

This analysis report demonstrates and analyzes the risk to The Boutique Hospital due to the regular Phishing and Social Engineering attacks. This document is built with minimal technical specifications to match the readability capacity of the executives in the organization.<br /><br />

In this Risk Assessment Report, I use the FAIR-U tool, created by RiskLens. FAIR-U uses the Factor Analysis of Information Risk framework to generate visualization of the Risk Exposure and potential loss in the report. The FAIR-U tool also analyzes the vulnerability percent and summarizes the primary and secondary losses expected if the vulnerabilities are not mitigated.
